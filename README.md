# 🍎 Blockchain-based Food Supply Chain Tracker with AR 🥑

Welcome to the Blockchain-based Food Supply Chain Tracker with AR! This project leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparent and immutable tracking of food supply chains, paired with Augmented Reality (AR) for interactive data visualization. With this solution, users can log food items on the blockchain, track their origins and current status, and even visualize their journey using AR.



# ⏳ Time-Limited Prototype
This project was developed as a proof of concept within a limited timeframe during a hackathon. While it demonstrates the core functionality of integrating blockchain technology and AR for food supply chain tracking, certain features are not fully fleshed out:
## 🚀 Key Features

1. Immutable Blockchain Integration
- Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts.
- Food supply chain data (food name, origin, and status) is securely logged on the blockchain.
- MetaMask is used for user authentication and blockchain interaction.
 2. QR Code Generation
- Every food item is assigned a unique QR code.
- Scanning the QR code retrieves its supply chain data directly from the blockchain.
3. Augmented Reality Visualization
- AR.js and A-Frame are used to implement AR experiences.
- Users can visualize a food item's journey from farm to table through their device's camera.
4. Real-time Data Tracking
- The system updates food item statuses in real-time on the blockchain, ensuring that supply chain records are always up to date.


## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript(Vanilla JS)  
**Blockchain:** Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.JS  
**AR Technology:** AR.js, A-Frame  
**QR Code API:** QRServer API

## 🔗 Smart Contract Deployment
To deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum test network:

- Install **Truffle and Ganache** for local development.
- Write and compile the **Solidity** smart contract.
- Migrate the contract to the **Ethereum test network** (Rinkeby/Goerli).

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
- **MetaMask** for blockchain interaction
- **QRServer API** for QR code generation
- **AR.js and A-Frame** for making AR accessible on the web
## 🎯 Why This Project?

- **Transparency**: Ensures food origin and status data cannot be tampered with, increasing trust among consumers.
- **Engagement**: Uses AR to provide an innovative way to engage consumers, enhancing user experience.
- **Innovation**: Combines blockchain and AR to solve a real-world problem—food supply chain transparency.
